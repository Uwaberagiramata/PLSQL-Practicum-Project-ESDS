# PLSQL-Practicum-Project-ESDS
**Early Spoilage Detection System (ESDS)**
A PL/SQL–based system designed to automatically detect, track, and alert staff about products approaching spoilage. This project focuses on reducing waste, improving stock freshness, and supporting data-driven inventory management.

**Project Overview**

The Early Spoilage Detection System (ESDS) monitors perishable inventory items by calculating expected spoilage dates and generating alerts when items fall below safety or freshness thresholds.

-The system uses PL/SQL triggers, functions, and stored procedures to:

-Detect items with short remaining shelf-life

-Insert automated alerts

-Track spoilage risk

-Support store managers with real-time insights

This project demonstrates real-world use of PL/SQL for automation, data integrity, and process optimization.

**Key Features**

-Automatic Spoilage Date Calculation when a new item is added

-Trigger-Based Alerts for items below the safety threshold

-Spoilage Risk Evaluation Function

-Daily Scheduled Check Procedure (simulation in PL/SQL)

-Alert Log for Managers

-Role-Based Access (Inventory Staff vs System vs Store Manager)

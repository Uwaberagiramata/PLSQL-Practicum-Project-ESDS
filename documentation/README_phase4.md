# 📌 Phase IV – Database Creation  
### Early Spoilage Detection System (ESDS)  

📖 1. Project Overview

This phase focuses on the creation and configuration of the Oracle Pluggable Database (PDB) for the Enterprise Smart Dairy System (ESDS).
The goal is to build a secure, scalable, and well-structured database environment that supports all system modules, including product tracking, inventory, spoilage alerts, and BI reporting.

This phase demonstrates my  ability to:

- Create a new Oracle PDB  
- Configure administrator users  
- Set up tablespaces  
- Enable essential database parameters  
- Prepare the environment for PL/SQL development

## 1. ERD DESCRIPTION (Place in erd_description.md)

**Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD) Overview**

The Early Spoilage Detection System (ESDS) uses six main tables. These tables capture product details, inventory stock, spoilage alerts, sales, supplier data, and environmental conditions. The ERD ensures clean relationships between data, prevents duplication, and allows efficient PL/SQL operations like triggers, functions, and analytics.

## Entities and Relationships

**1. PRODUCTS**

Central table that stores product information.

Connected to Inventory, SpoilageAlerts, Sales, Supplier and StorageConditions.

Primary Key: ProductID

**2. INVENTORY**

Monitors quantity and location of stored products.

FK ProductID → Products.ProductID

A product can appear in inventory many times.

Relationship:
Products (1) — (Many) Inventory

**3. SPOILAGE ALERTS**

Stores spoilage warnings generated by PL/SQL triggers and functions.

FK ProductID → Products.ProductID

Relationship:
Products (1) — (Many) SpoilageAlerts

**4. SALES**

Tracks product sales.

Useful for BI dashboards such as stock turnover rate.

FK ProductID → Products.ProductID

Relationship:
Products (1) — (Many) Sales

**5. SUPPLIERS**

Stores supplier information.

Products may be associated later in Phase IV or extended model (optional).

**6. STORAGE CONDITIONS**

Logs temperature and humidity readings.

Used for spoilage prediction.

FK ProductID → Products.ProductID

Relationship:
Products (1) — (Many) StorageConditions

## Normalization Summary

All tables conform to:

1NF: No repeating groups; atomic values.

2NF: No partial dependencies (all PKs are single-column).

3NF: Non-key attributes depend only on their PK.
